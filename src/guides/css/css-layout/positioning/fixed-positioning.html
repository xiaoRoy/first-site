    <h1>Fixed positioning</h1>

    <p>
      I am a basic block level element. My adjacent block level elements sit on
      new lines below me.
    </p>

    <p class="positioned">I'm not positioned any more.</p>

    <p>
      We are separated by our margins. Because of margin collapsing, we are
      separated by the width of one of our margins, not both.
    </p>

    <p>
      Inline elements <span>like this one</span> and <span>this one</span> sit
      on the same line as one another, and adjacent text nodes, if there is
      space on the same line. Overflowing inline elements
      <span
        >wrap onto a new line if possible â€” like this one containing text</span
      >, or just go on to a new line if not, much like this image will do:
      <img src="./images/long.jpg" alt="snippet of cloth" />
    </p>
